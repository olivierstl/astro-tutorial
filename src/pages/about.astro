        Hi, I am Olivier, I've been working in the web for more than 10 years. During those years, I had the chance to work in the fields of design and conception, front-end development or WordPress theme development. Since 2017, I work as a full-time front-end developer.
      </p>
      <p>
        Familiar with <abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr>, <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> and <abbr title="JavaScript">JS</abbr> standards, <abbr title="Syntactically Awesome Style Sheets">SASS</abbr> or even Vue.js or TypeScript, my experience as a designer allows me to provide a transverse approach to the projects I join.
      </p>
      <p>
        The first webconferences I attended made me aware of the need to put accessibility at the forefront, even before becoming a full-time front-end developer. Getting the certification "Develop accessible websites" at Access42, I officially specialize in this field in the early 2021.
